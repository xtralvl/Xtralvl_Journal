# Xtralvl Journal 💯

Xtralvl Journal is a modern, interactive experience logging app that I originally started **just for myself** to track my experiences and skills.  
It allows you to log your adventures, search through past experiences, edit or delete entries, and even generate random experiences to inspire you.  
This keeps your personal journey organized and interactive.  

**Note:** Since it started as a personal project, it currently **does not include a registration or login system**, though this may be added in the future.  

The app is **hosted on AWS** and built using **React, TypeScript, Vite, and SCSS**, making it fast, responsive, and ready for future expansions like serverless functions.
